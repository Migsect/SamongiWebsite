            I have multiple game projects in the works that are traditional board/card games as well as standalone computer games.  I also create some plugins for the sandbox game Minecraft making use of <a target="_blank" href="https://bukkit.org/pages/about-us/">Bukkit</a> / <a target="_blank" href="https://www.spigotmc.org/">Spigot</a> API to add new features to the game or completely rework the game entirely.

            In my freetime I enjoy playing computer games that often deal with creation, progression, and problem solving that I often share the experience with friends. Aside from that I enjoy writing science/fantasy fiction as well as working on my various programming and non-programming related game projects.

            <div class="staff_about">
            Working in the Product Validation department of the Lifecycle Collaboration organization, I got the opportunity to work with Siemens PLM's <a href="https://www.plm.automation.siemens.com/en_us/products/teamcenter/" target="_blank">Teamcenter</a> software.  My duties included running installation tests for teamcenter as well as developing an automated testing framework for Teamcenter's installation GUI using <a href="https://marathontesting.com/" target="_blank">Marathon</a>.

            <div class="staff_about">
            During this COOP term I learned the basics and importance of testing as well as how to execute, write, and update tests. The term also introduced me to the concept of Software Engineering as seperate from Computer Science as a subject.
            </div>
            <div class="staff_about">
            Furthermore during this COOP I have learned how to ask good questions to coworkers. At the beginning of the term when I was asking questions I didn't provide information that was useful to the person my questions were directed at. Now when I ask a question I make sure to include enough information such that the person receiving the question is able to formulate a response.

            <div class="staff_about">
            During this term I continued to work in the Product Validation department. However this time my duties shifted from manual testing to working with testing automation. This testing automation continued with my Marathon project from the previous semester but also I got exposure to automated testing with Siemen PLM's <a href="http://www.plm.automation.siemens.com/en_us/products/teamcenter/active-workspace/" target="_blank">Active Workspace</a> software. When working with Active Workspace I was checking to ensure that the automated tests were correctly identifying faults as well as sometimes running the automated tests myself.
            </div>
            <div class="staff_about">
            This term had a focus on testing automation and my exposure to the automation has brought me into new light with how software can be tested. Automating tests allow software engineers to know quicker if there are issues in the software as well as open the door to testing that would be impossible or unpleasant to manually test.
            </div>
            <div class="staff_about">
            This term also had a great deal more meetings than my previous term. Furthermore I had to present to a few dozen people (over teleconferance) on how to setup the environment such that they could run automated tests for Active Workspace.
